# Getting started

The local development setup runs on local Django server.

The current development have dependencies on cloud service:

* Working PostgreSQL server
* Google Cloud storage for static assets hosting

You should follow the [GCE tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/python/django/kubernetes-engine) to setup these dependencies.
A work in progress tutorial to [setup Django channel with GCE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iTl5Tw9hwppsO0YA-eoGt9mfwUwJg1q6LLMv-qYlWWE/edit#) is also available.

After the above setup, you can run:

```
cd web
# Build SPA and Collect static file
make build-deploy-spa

# create development server
make dev
```

# Folder structure

* [Django app](/web) is in the `/web`
* [React SPA app used by slideshow](/web/slideshow-spa) is in `/web/slideshow-spa`
